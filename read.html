            Books developed my character. Stories, at their core, are a representation of how admirable characters overcome adversity.

            My favorite book is Plato’s <em>Republic</em>. It instilled values like, "work should be done in service to others, doing one’s work without getting in another's way is justice, and leading a 'just' life is a better life."
          </p>

            A friend of mine recommended <em>The Fountainhead</em> because she thought I reminded her of the protagonist, Howard Roark. He's an architect who cares deeply about his work, but his lack of interest in other's small-minded discussions. He appears self-centered at first, but his passion for architecture creates astounding positive impact on society. The people who live in his buildings feel taken care more than ever. The city's government couldn't build public-housing because every other architect told them it was impossible on their budget. Howard Roark came in, designed the housing under budget, and created better results for residents. Regardless of the results, his peers ostracized him for his disinterest in them; he stepped on their egos. Despite the attacks from his peers, he ends up being the most altruistic character in the story. There are few guideposts in life, but <em>The Fountainhead</em> is one.

            Elon Musk’s biography is where I discovered how to enact my values in a modern context. He took his desire to protect life and created a business to do it.
          </p>
          <p class="col-12">
            Many other books shape my personality, and I regularly find more. <em>Lab Girl</em> and <em>Hillbilly Elegy</em> are useful examples of how to gracefully shoulder stress. (If you’re curious, <em>War & Peace</em>, <em>Letters from a Stoic</em>, and <em>The Inheritance Cycle</em> are good as well.)
