            <p class="text-secondary"><em>ex-IDEO Director of 19 years</em></p>
            <p>I had the pleasure of working and collaborating with John. <b>He is a fantastic product manager and design thinker. He is very creative, well versed in his craft, and shows great empathy with the users.</b> He is always open to ideas from all members and strives to get the best results in design and product development.</p>
            <p>John and I worked together for 1 ½ years at Simplisafe. He introduced me to the company and the details of the organization. Together we crafted research initiatives and user interviews that were profound to our current developments. John fully embraces Design Thinking, and he pushed for activities to better understand the user's needs. He embraces new ideas, creative workshops, brainstorms, and analogous activities to better inform our product ideation. John even kept a secret stash of chocolate to give teams the extra sugar level for brainstorms.</p>
            <p>He helped me build the design team within Simplisafe through endless support for interviews and candidates' selection. All of this, he did on top of managing product development activities and product launches. I am thankful for the opportunity to have worked with John at Simplisafe, and I really hope that we will cross paths again.</p>

            <p class="text-secondary"><em>Engineering leader with 20 years of experience</em></p>
            <p>John and I worked together during our mutual time at SimpliSafe.   John was the Product Manager for the development projects my team and I were assigned to.  These projects include a smoke/CO detector, external siren, and a new entry sensor.   John was thorough with his product requirements and was able to quickly answer questions we had as we defined the technical solutions.  John always tries to learn and understand the technical aspects of the design so that he can make better product requirements in the future.  <b>He manages the products well and did a great job preventing scope creep,</b> especially from us engineers.   I highly recommend John and I hope to work with him again in the future.</p>

            <p>Dedicated, attentive and stellar are just a few of John’s qualities. I worked alongside John for two years on countless projects. John’s results driven attitude and resourcefulness was a key factor in our successful product launches, and smooth project kickoffs. John was able to meticulously juggle both new initiatives and system upgrades critical to the company’s success. <b>John’s ability to listen, digest and discuss any technical discussion or issue, made him a key resource</b> to provide critical feedback. John’s work ethic, genuine personality, and as an all-around heavy hitter would make him a key player on anyone’s team.</p>
