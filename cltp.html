            I coach college students about how to become effective group leaders and team members. The coaching day at Babson College consists of a three-hour case challenge where students solve real-world business scenarios under pressure. Coaches preside over the case session and observe how students think, act, and collaborate. Students only learn the identity of their coach until the second half of the day, when coaches meet one-on-one to offer constructive criticism.
          </p>
          <p class="col-12">
            Coaches go through a weekend-long training course about how to give feedback and the subtler nuances of being a leader/teammate. Babson invites certified coaches to be mentors for the leadership and teamwork training program required for students in their Freshman and Senior years. Students come away with real-life context and additional confidence about how to affect change in their group work.
          </p>
          <p class="col-12">
            It is one of the most meritorious programs Babson offers and excites students to continue becoming leaders and team members in their coursework and later in their careers. I went through the program when I was a student and clearly remember the heartwarming feeling of being mentored by a successful business professional. I look to pass this onto other students in the program.
