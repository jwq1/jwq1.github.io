          Hi Facebook team,
          </p>

          <p>
            I noticed you don't take cover letters, only links, so I made a page on my website instead (I know Google Drive or Dropbox are the norms, but where's the fun in that?). I want to work for FB Reality Labs, so <a href="https://www.facebook.com/careers/jobs/1145881792456457/" target="_blank">this specialty opening</a> was a perfect chance for me to follow-up.
          </p>

          <p>
          I think I’d be a good fit for the Reality Labs (FRL) team because of the following (bulleted, because who has time for reading?).
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li><b>I have 6 years of hardware and software PM experience.</b> I launched the <a href="https://www.simplisafe.com/smart-lock/" target="_blank">SimpliSafe Smart Lock</a>, and I manage the <a href="https://simplisafe.com/build-my-system">IoT suite</a> with 3 million customers. Small potatoes compared to Facebook, but I think the experience will scale well.</li>
            <li><b>I've coordinate across departments and manage simultaneous initiatives.</b> I work with the mobile, platform, and hardware engineers, and help them drive decisions across departments. I balance simultaneous initiatives spanning advanced development, lifecycle management, and new product launches.</li>
            <li><b>I'm data-driven</b> and focused on hitting milestones agreed upon by investors. SimpliSafe was venture-backed and is rigorous about performance measurement. Before SimpliSafe, I worked at <a href="https://www.nielsen.com/us/en/" target="_blank">Nielsen</a>, another data-driven company.</li>
            <li><b>I’m passionate about designing user interactions,</b> I have an <a href="https://www.olin.edu/" target="_blank">Olin College</a> Certificate of Engineering, with a concentration in <a href="https://www.olin.edu/academic-life/experience/user-oriented-collaborative-design/" target="_blank">Human-Centered Design</a> to back it up (a mouthful, I know.. ) The Reality Labs team is pushing UX's bounds with new user interfaces, and my background affords me the ability to think about these interactions from first principles. I'd be excited to join a team where I can put my skill set to use.</li>
            <li><b>I offer a unique perspective,</b> which enabled me to prioritize five new initiatives on the SimpliSafe 3-year roadmap. I say I offer a unique perspective because I love technology, but I minimize how much I use it. By reducing how much tech I use, I see products from a fresh perspective. I've done the advanced development work for five of SimpliSafe's current initiatives. The early research I did was successful enough to merit three new PM hires this year to handle the new projects. I collaborate with <a href="http://www.dirkahlgrim.com/dp/" target="_blank">designers</a> from <a href="https://www.ideo.com/" target="">IDEO</a> daily and enjoy searching for innovative new ideas.</li>
            <li><b>You could say I’m a nerd about game design, <a href="https://www.johnwilliamquinn.com/play.html" target="_blank">storytelling</a>, and behavioral psychology.</b> I'm interested in these disciplines because they're the heart of what motivates us as humans. I apply this knowledge to make people feel more confident, fulfilled, and happy while engaging with various products. At SimpliSafe, I help users feel sure about their installation process and help them overcome mistakes. On the FRL Platform team, these skills can create developer-focused tools that developers clamor to use. I'd like to join your team in an attempt to make the FRL Platform a first choice for AR/VR developers.</li>
            <li><b>I care about diversity, ethics, and community,</b> making me a great culture fit for Facebook. I designed a Babson College "Senior-Led Seminar" about intercultural communications, <a href="http://johnwilliamquinn.com/volunteer-new.html">volunteer</a> to coach younger students, and was a Babson spokesperson for inclusion and diversity. This focus on people and community makes me a strong culture fit for Facebook.</li>
          </ol>

          <p>
          I think that about sums it up. I hope you'll consider me for your team. I look forward to chatting with you further if you decide to reach out.
          </p>
